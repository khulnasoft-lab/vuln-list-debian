  "Description": [
    "lightweight wrapper to collect execution data for a command con-duct provides a duct command which is a lightweight wrapper that collects execution data for an arbitrary command.  Execution data includes execution time, system information, and resource usage statistics of the command and all its child processes. It is intended to simplify the problem of recording the resources necessary to execute a command, particularly in an HPC environment. . Resource usage is determined by polling (at a sample-interval). During execution, duct produces a JSON lines file with one data point recorded for each report (at a report-interval)."
